I'm a research assistant at TUM, passionate about bridging the gap between simulation and reality (sim-to-real transfer) in robotics. My work focuses on combining **reinforcement learning** and **control theory** to create robust, reliable robotic systems.

- ðŸ”­ Currently working on applying robot learning for industrial robots in manufacturing and intralogistics.
- ðŸŒ± Exploring robust reinforcement learning and inverse dynamics modeling for sim-to-real transfer.
- âš¡ Fun fact: *No way to avoid the butterfly effect ðŸŒ€*
